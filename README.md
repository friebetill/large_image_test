Small repository to show that images are not loaded on some (maybe slow or old) devices.
There are three images in the repository:
- `test_image_1.jpg` with 3.7MB
- `test_image_2.jpg` with 1.3M
- `test_image_3.jpeg` with 52K

If you want to look at all images, there are problems with some devices that the `test_image_1.jpg` is not displayed.
Tested this on
- Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with Android 5.0 -> `test_image_1.jpg` is not displayed
- Galaxy J6+ with Android 8.1.0 -> `test_image_1.jpg` is not displayed
- Nexus 5 with Android 8.1.0 -> all pictures are displayed
